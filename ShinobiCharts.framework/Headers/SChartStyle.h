/** A look of a chart is managed by an instance of `SChartTheme` or one of its sub-classes.  Themes contain a set of style objects, each of which are responsible for managing the look of a particular aspect of the chart.
 
 The `SChartStyle` class is responsible for managing the overall look of the chart.  This includes things like:
 
 - The background color of the chart.
 - The color and width of the chart border.
 - The background color of the chart plot area.
 - The color and width of the chart plot area border.
 
 More information about using `SChartStyle` can be found in the [user guide](styling-a-chart.html).
